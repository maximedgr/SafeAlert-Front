## safe-alert

Safe Alert allows you to report a bug pseudonymically by directly contacting the protocol concerned. Fill out the form with all the information relating to the bug. You will be able to exchange about the resolution of the problem, a bounty...

In case where the protocol concerned does not respond to your request, does not correct the bug, doesn't deal with you, you will have the possibility of directly publishing a bug report to inform users of the risks incurred.

Everything is encrypted end-to-end client side and we guarantee you increased security via Privy technology.
